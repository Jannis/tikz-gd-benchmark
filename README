Description
===========

This repository contains a script (generate-graphs.rb), a configuration
file (repository.json) and a library of test graphs (src/) to test
TikZ graph drawing algorithms with.

The script allows families of graphs as well as individual graphs to
be drawn or regenerated independently. It provides a command-line
interface for testers to select algorithms and control the output
verbosity. The configuration file makes it possible to adjust
TikZ options for families of graphs, individual graphs for all
algorithms as well as only for specific algorithms.

The PDFs containing the graph drawings are generated from templates
in the templates/ folder. The example templates require ConTeXt, but
it is easy to replace them with templates written for LaTeX.
